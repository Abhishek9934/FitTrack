# Fitness Tracker Deployment Guide

## Overview
Your fitness tracker app uses CSV files for data storage, making it simple to deploy without requiring a separate database server. Here are several deployment options:

## Option 1: Streamlit Cloud (Free & Easy)
**Best for: Quick deployment with minimal setup**

### Requirements:
- GitHub account
- Your code in a GitHub repository

### Setup Steps:
1. **Prepare Repository:**
   - Remove custom port configuration from `.streamlit/config.toml`
   - Use `streamlit_requirements.txt` for dependencies
   - Ensure `app.py` is in the root directory

2. **Deploy:**
   - Push code to GitHub
   - Go to [share.streamlit.io](https://share.streamlit.io)
   - Connect GitHub account
   - Select repository and `app.py`
   - Deploy

### Important Configuration Fix:
Your app was configured for port 5000, but Streamlit Cloud uses the default port 8501. I've updated the configuration to be compatible with both environments.

### Pros:
- Free hosting
- Automatic deployments on code changes
- Built-in SSL certificates
- Easy domain management

### Cons:
- Data stored in temporary storage (resets on app restart)
- Limited to Streamlit Cloud infrastructure

### Data Persistence Note:
For Streamlit Cloud, consider upgrading to a paid plan or use external storage (Google Sheets, GitHub files) for data persistence.

## Option 2: Docker + VPS/Cloud Server
**Best for: Full control and persistent data**

### Requirements:
- VPS or cloud server (DigitalOcean, Linode, AWS EC2, etc.)
- Docker installed

### Setup Files Needed:
1. `Dockerfile`
2. `docker-compose.yml`
3. `requirements.txt`

### Steps:
1. Create Docker container
2. Deploy to your VPS
3. Set up reverse proxy (nginx)
4. Configure SSL certificate

### Pros:
- Full control over server
- Persistent data storage
- Custom domain
- Scalable

### Cons:
- Requires server management
- Monthly hosting costs ($5-20/month)

## Option 3: Railway (Simple Cloud Deployment)
**Best for: Easy deployment with persistent storage**

### Requirements:
- GitHub account
- Railway account

### Steps:
1. Push code to GitHub
2. Connect Railway to your repository
3. Railway auto-detects Streamlit
4. Add volume for data persistence
5. Deploy

### Pros:
- Simple deployment
- Persistent storage
- Automatic SSL
- Custom domains

### Cons:
- Paid service after free tier

## Option 4: Heroku Alternative (Render/Fly.io)
**Best for: Platform-as-a-Service deployment**

Similar to Heroku but with better pricing and performance.

## Recommended Approach for Your App

Given that your app uses CSV files, I recommend **Option 2 (Docker + VPS)** for the following reasons:

1. **Data Persistence**: Your CSV files will be preserved between restarts
2. **Cost Effective**: $5-10/month for a basic VPS
3. **Full Control**: You can backup, migrate, and manage your data
4. **Scalability**: Can upgrade server resources as needed

## Files I'll Create for Docker Deployment

Would you like me to create the necessary files for Docker deployment? I can generate:

1. `Dockerfile` - Container configuration
2. `docker-compose.yml` - Service orchestration
3. `requirements.txt` - Python dependencies
4. `nginx.conf` - Reverse proxy configuration
5. `deploy.sh` - Deployment script

## Data Backup Strategy

Since you're using CSV files, I recommend:
1. Regular automated backups to cloud storage
2. Version control for your data files
3. Database migration option for future scaling
